# Task 1 Summary â€“ Project Setup and Orientation

## Objective
The whole project aims to build mutltiple things:
1. I am trying to build a simple AI agent to prioritize a daily task list.
2. Another project is to develop a game prototype, and integrate AI agents that can learn from user behavior. 
3. Tools used include Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Pygame, matplotlib and also include make and similar platforms.

## What I Did
- Set up a GitHub repo and cloned it locally using SSH.
- Created a virtual environment and installed all required packages.
- Initialized Git and created a clean folder structure for tasks.
- Wrote a summary for the project requirements in this folder.  

## Key Learnings
- Rule-based agents follow hardcoded logic to make decisions (e.g., sort by deadline + importance).
- ML-based agents use data to learn patterns (e.g., using a decision tree to learn prioritization).
- AI agents operate in an environment and take actions based on states and goals.

## Next Steps
I will begin **Task 2** by:
- Creating a structured to-do dataset (task name, deadline, importance).
- Implementing a rule-based prioritization system using `pandas`.
- Enhancing the system using a decision tree model (`scikit-learn`) to learn task priority patterns.
